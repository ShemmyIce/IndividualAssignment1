                <h2 id="book">Twelve Pillars</h2>    
                <p>The writers stress that perseverance and a strong work ethic are essential for success. They contend that wishing for success is insufficient; one also needs 
                    to be willing to work hard to make it happen. I can relate to this approach because I frequently find myself wishing to achieve goals without completely 
                    committing to the required actions. I want to take a more proactive stance going forward and divide more difficult projects into smaller, more doable steps. 
                    This will enable me to take on challenging undertakings and feel accomplished at each turn, which will boost my drive to keep going.</p>
            <h3>The Pillar of Self Discipline </h3>
                <p> It is said that the foundation of long-term success is self-discipline. Rohn and Widener emphasize the value of postponing gratification and making decisions 
                    that support my objectives. It has dawned on me that my inclination to pursue instant gratification may impede my advancement. I will create a disciplined 
                    schedule that includes activities like regular exercise and daily journaling in order to develop more self-discipline. I may establish habits that complement 
                    my goals and foster a sense of accountability by designating certain times for these activities.</p>
            <h3>The Pillar of Responsibility</h3>
                <p>Accepting responsibility for one's life and decisions is a major theme in these chapters. Rather than placing the blame elsewhere, the writers exhort their 
                    readers to take responsibility for their situation. This viewpoint has made me think about my own propensity to place the blame elsewhere when I encounter 
                    difficulties. I will deliberately remind myself to accept responsibility for my choices and the results in order to change this mindset. Through a critical 
                    analysis of my controllable circumstances and a solution-oriented mindset, I can reclaim my own agency and effect significant personal change.</p>
            <h3>The Pillar of Vision</h3>
                <p>As the writers say, having a distinct vision acts as a compass. A clear vision serves as a compass for me, guiding me through obstacles and sustaining my motivation. 
                    I intend to take the time to properly state my long-term goals because I frequently feel lost or aimless. My dream board will serve as a visual aid for these objectives 
                    since it will symbolize my aspirations. This concrete reminder will help me stay focused on my goals and motivate me to take concrete efforts toward achieving them.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion and Application</h3>
                <p>Bringing these four pillars into my everyday life will need deliberate thought and work. I understand that success is a journey defined by constant actions and decisions 
                    rather than a destination. I can develop a more capable and intentional way of living if I accept responsibility, embrace hard work, practice self-discipline, and keep a 
                    clear vision. For example, I can adhere to the Pillar of Work by beginning each day with a concentrated mentality and allocating particular time blocks to my most critical 
                    duties. I'll keep a notebook to document my routines as I work toward self-discipline, documenting both my accomplishments and my shortcomings. By accepting accountability 
                    for my activities, I'll establish a monthly review procedure to evaluate my development and pinpoint any changes required to keep moving forward. Finally, I can make sure 
                    that my objectives are still exciting and relevant by periodically reviewing and updating my vision board.</p>
